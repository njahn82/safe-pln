## Characteristics

The SAFE-PLN is based on the following principles:

- a light organizational structure based on a memorandum of understanding
- an international federation, not limited to a specific region, country or organization
- each partner keeps technical control over their collections (local technical administration)
- each partner can monitor its preserved content over the network
- budgets remain independent
